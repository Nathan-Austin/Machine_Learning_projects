# Car price Prediction

In this notebook, I model the resale price of a car based on its new and current price, milage, number or owners, age and fuel type.

I have also included a GUI interface for the user to imput thier own data and calculate the price of a car.

Run the notebook and then run the last cell and input the information and the model will return the resale price of the car.
