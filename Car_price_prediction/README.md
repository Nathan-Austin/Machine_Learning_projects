## Overview

Accurately predicting car prices is a crucial task for various industries, including dealerships, insurance companies, and private buyers. This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to estimate car prices based on historical data.

---

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends and correlations within the data.
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Dataset

- **Features Include**:
  - **Make/Model**: Manufacturer and model of the car.
  - **Year**: Year of manufacture.
  - **Mileage**: Total distance traveled by the car.
  - **Engine Size**: Displacement of the engine.
  - **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
  - **Price**: Target variable for prediction.

### Source

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (please replace with the actual source if different).

## Modeling

The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms:

1. **Baseline Model**: Linear Regression.
2. **Tree-Based Models**: Decision Tree, Random Forest.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilizes GridSearchCV for fine-tuning model parameters.
